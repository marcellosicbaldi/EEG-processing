# 3-Stimulus oddball paradigm

The goal of this short project is to process, analyze and interpret the EEG of a single healthy subject who performed a 3-stimulus oddball task.

The classical 2-stimulus oddball task consists in presenting repeatedly two different stimuli in a random sequence: one stimulus, called standard, occurs frequently, while the other stimulus occurs infrequently and is called target since the subject is instructed to respond in some way to this rare stimulus. The 3-stimulus oddball task is a modification of the 2-stimulus task where a third stimulus is added, occurring infrequently as the target stimulus, and called distractor. In this case too, the subject has to respond only to the target stimulus. In the specific 3-stimulus auditory oddball task, the standard stimulus was a 440 Hz sinusoidal tone (70% of trials), the target stimulus was a 660 Hz sinusoidal tone (15% of trials) and the distractor (15% of trials) was a naturalistic sound. Each stimulus lasted 200 ms. The subject was instructed to mentally count the target stimuli and ignoring the standard and distractor stimuli.

The ERP waveform associated to the target stimulus displays P300, which is maximal over the parietal and central electrodes, while the P300 is not present in the ERP waveform associated to the standard stimulus. The P3 peak has been associated to voluntary attentional components, recognition of stimulus relevance for the task, and memory updating. 	The P3 evoked by this two-stimulus oddball task is often referred to as P3b, in order to distinguish it from a variant, called P3a.	
The latter appears when a third ‘novel’ (still rare) stimulus is inserted into the oddball task, and the subject is not required to respond to this stimulus (also called ‘distractor’). ‘Novelty’ refers to the context of the other two stimuli. Such novel stimuli elicit a large positivity (P3a) with a latency that is earlier than that of the target-evoked P3b, and a scalp distribution that is more oriented towards the front of the scalp. P3a has been linked to involuntary capture of attention
