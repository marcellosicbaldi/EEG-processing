# REST TASK REST
The goal of this short project is to investigate ALPHA POWER changes between rest and task conditions.  
### Data and experiment
The analysis is performed on 13 EEG signals acquired on a single subject during an initial relax phase (R1), a central task phase (T) consisting in solving arithmetic operations, and a final relax phase (R2). Each phase lasted 5 minutes
### Results

Alpha power is much higher in the posterior regions of the scalp. Moreover, alpha power is dominant during the rest phases and minimum during the task phase. We can also observe that it is higher in the R2 phase than in the R1 phase, suggesting that the subject is more relaxed after haiving finished the task with respect to before the task. This confirms the role of the alpha ryhthm in ISOLATING the subject from the external environment, acting as an INTERNAL ATTENTION mechanism.
