# Classification of motor imagery with a Convolutional Neural Network

The goal of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 4 different imagined movements from single EEG trials.

## Data and experimental paradigm

[BCI Competition 2008](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf)

## Results

The model reaches and accuracy of 77%

## Interpretation

The channels in which we have an higher value (red) are the one that helped the net the most in discriminating between the 4 classes (in those channels the signal are the most different for all 4 conditions)
